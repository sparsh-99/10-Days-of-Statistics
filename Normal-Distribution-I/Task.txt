Task
In a certain plant, the time taken to assemble a car is a random variable,X, having a normal distribution with a mean of 20 hours and a standard deviation of 2 hours. What is the probability that a car can be assembled at this plant in:

1. Less than 19 hours?
2. Between 20 and 22 hours?


Input Format

There are  lines of input (shown below):

20 2
19.5
20 22

The first line contains 2 space-separated values denoting the respective mean and standard deviation for X. The second line contains the number associated with question 1. The third line contains 2 space-separated values describing the respective lower and upper range boundaries for question 2.

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.
